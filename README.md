# Netflix Recommender System

Mariam Javed, DSI-TOR

### Overview

All Netflix fans are familiar with the "Because you watched X" section, where Netflix tries to rope you into spending more time (than you already do) infront of the TV. This is a classic example of a recommendation system that uses an item-item recommendation.

### Problem Statement

Using a smaller version of the [MovieLens](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MovieLens) dataset, develop our own "Netflix" Recommeder System that generates item-item recommendations using the collaborative filtering technique.

---

### Executive Summary

Many different types of recommender systems exists - in this project we're interested in exploring the collaborative filtering technique using kNN 'cosine' metric.

Although this recommender seemed to be successful at making recommendations, it would be beneficial to explore the other techiniques such as popularity based and content based recommendation engines and compare how each do.
